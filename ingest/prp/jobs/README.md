# Why run Kubernetes jobs?

If someone has an amazing new analysis that they want to use on the data, they have to recreate the same analysis on each new data set. They could give me their analysis to automate into ingest, but then I would have to take the time to understand the analysis in order to correctly and efficiently automate it, while also downloading the right packages. With the kubernetes jobs, one can automatically upload the analysis they want done and then have it done with all subsequent data sets.
